<h3>Where do you find the data?</h3>

<p>In order to get information beyond title and abstract (such as number of citations), we are using the database from  <a href="https://inspirehep.net/" target="_blank">INSPIRE</a>.
The website also provide a convenient API (see <a href="http://inspirehep.net/info/hep/api" target="_blank">here</a>), which allows to directly use the database (or part of it) in Python.
The database used on the present website is restricted to articles that were put on <a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a> in the category Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (commonly known as <a href="https://arxiv.org/list/astro-ph.CO/recent">astro-ph.CO</a>). </p>

<h3>How do you find recommendations?</h3>

<p>The recommendations are based on the similarities in the abstracts. In order to quantify how similar two abstracts are, one needs a vector space and a distance.
A powerful way to vectorize sentences is through the use of word embeddings, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec">Word2Vec</a>. These type of algorithms allow to represent large
corpus in a relatively low dimensional space, while keeping similarities between words: the classical example is that, in the vector space, one typically has Vector(King)-Vector(Man)+Vector(Woman) = Vector(Queen).
In the present case, we use the implementation of word2vec in the gensim library for python. More specifically, we use word2vec for the words in the sentences of the abstract. To associate a vector to the full abstract,
we take the mean of the word vectors, weighted by the inverse document frequency (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf">IDF</a>), to give more importance to words that are specific to the abstract.
Then, we use a K-means clustering algorithm to regroup articles that are similar. The final step is to take the 5 suggestions which are closest to the article, according to their cosine similarity. </p>
